#  G-loc â€“ Global Live Observation and Camera Viewer

**G-loc** is a Python application that displays an interactive world map with clickable markers representing real-time public camera feeds from across the globe. Built with `pygame`, it allows users to visually explore live streams simply by clicking on the dots on the map.

---

##  How It Works

- A world map is displayed using `pygame`, and camera feed markers are overlaid using latitude and longitude coordinates.
- When a user clicks a marker, a **feed window** opens showing details and launches the camera feed (usually in the default web browser).
- Camera sources are pulled from organized region-based files (like `regions/europe.py`).
